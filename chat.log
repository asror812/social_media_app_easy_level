* i shared image of test columns and asked which column answer the question of "test coverage"
The test coverage is displayed in the right panel under "Element," showing percentages for class, method, line, and branch coverage.

    Class Coverage: Percentage of classes covered by tests.
    Method Coverage: Percentage of methods covered.
    Line Coverage: Percentage of lines of code executed by tests.
    Branch Coverage: Percentage of branches (if-else conditions) covered.

For example:

    PostController has 100% line coverage (5/5 lines tested).
    UserController has 71% line coverage (5/7 lines tested).
    PostDao and UserDao have 0% line coverage (not tested).


If youâ€™re looking for coverage at a specific line in the code editor, the yellow light bulb (on line 38) might indicate that the line is not fully covered by tests.
* You said:
so when they want test coverage over 80 percent which percentage they mean ?
ChatGPT said:

When someone wants test coverage over 80%, they typically refer to line coverage, meaning that at least 80% of the lines in the codebase should be executed by tests. However, in some cases, they might also consider method coverage or branch coverage, depending on the project's quality requirements.
Breakdown of the Coverage Metrics:

    Class Coverage: How many classes have at least some of their code executed by tests.
    Method Coverage: How many methods are executed by tests.
    Line Coverage (most commonly used): The percentage of lines executed at least once by tests.
    Branch Coverage (strictest): The percentage of conditional branches (e.g., if-else) that have been tested.

In your case:

    Your overall line coverage is 20% (38/188 lines tested).
    Your method coverage is 26% (36/136 methods tested).
    Your branch coverage is 0%, meaning no conditional logic has been explicitly tested.

ðŸ‘‰ If the requirement is 80% test coverage, they likely mean 80% line coverage.
You need to write more tests that execute more lines of your code, especially in dao and dto packages, where coverage is currently low or zero.



* i have users table and need to realize following so user could follow many other users ?

To implement a feature where a user can follow many other users in your application, you can introduce a "follower" relationship. Here's a step-by-step guide using a relational database approach:

    Create a User Table: Ensure your users table is set up properly. This table will store user information.
